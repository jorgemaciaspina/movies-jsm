# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.


# This is a repo where I followed a tutorial, here is the URL to that tutorial to practice the basics of react + vite
[Tutorial on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCLhUialKPQ)

## What You could learn
- Basics of react
- How to build a SPA easily
- Basic usage of Appwrite (1st time for me)
- Usage of APIs

The tutorial is very good IMO, it covers all the basics and gives you a nice looking result.
